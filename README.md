# 🧩 Bloxely — Build Your Focus, Block by Block  

Bloxely is a **focus dashboard** designed to keep things simple and distraction-free.  
It’s not as overwhelming as Notion, and not as limited as sticky notes — instead, you create your own personalized dashboard with only the tools you need.  

With **Bloxely**, you stay productive by focusing on what matters today, not everything at once.

## 🌱 Inspiration

I’ve always struggled with focus. Most dashboards show too much and make me lose clarity, while sticky notes are too simple to manage real tasks. I kept asking myself: *what if I only saw the top priorities for today and nothing else?*

I tried it first with a notebook. I focused on just one or two things, and my productivity improved dramatically. That experiment became the seed for **Bloxely**.

Bloxely is about helping you block out distractions and build a dashboard that adapts to your workflow — not the other way around.
