# Wallpaper Background Fix Requirements

## Introduction

The wallpaper selector feature has been implemented but users cannot see the background changes when clicking on different wallpaper options. The wallpaper context and selector UI work correctly, but the visual changes are not appearing on the canvas/dashboard background. This spec addresses fixing the wallpaper visibility issue to ensure users can see immediate visual feedback when changing background patterns.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Visible Wallpaper Changes

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see immediate visual changes to the dashboard background when I select different wallpaper options, so that I can customize my workspace appearance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click on the wallpaper selector button THEN I SHALL see a dropdown with 6 wallpaper options (dots, grid, waves, geometric, gradient, solid)
2. WHEN I select a different wallpaper option THEN the dashboard background SHALL immediately change to reflect the selected pattern
3. WHEN I switch between light and dark themes THEN the wallpaper patterns SHALL adapt appropriately to the theme
4. WHEN I refresh the page THEN my selected wallpaper SHALL persist and be visible

### Requirement 2: Proper CSS Application

**User Story:** As a user, I want the wallpaper styles to be properly applied to the visible canvas area, so that the background patterns are clearly visible behind my widgets.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a wallpaper is selected THEN the CSS classes SHALL be correctly applied to the appropriate DOM elements
2. WHEN the wallpaper changes THEN the previous wallpaper styles SHALL be completely removed
3. WHEN widgets are present THEN the wallpaper SHALL be visible in the background without interfering with widget readability
4. WHEN zooming in or out THEN the wallpaper patterns SHALL maintain their visual integrity

### Requirement 3: Pattern Visibility and Quality

**User Story:** As a user, I want each wallpaper pattern to be clearly distinguishable and visually appealing, so that I can choose the one that best suits my preferences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I select the "dots" pattern THEN I SHALL see a subtle dot grid pattern
2. WHEN I select the "grid" pattern THEN I SHALL see clean grid lines
3. WHEN I select the "waves" pattern THEN I SHALL see soft gradient wave effects
4. WHEN I select the "geometric" pattern THEN I SHALL see a diamond/geometric pattern
5. WHEN I select the "gradient" pattern THEN I SHALL see a smooth color gradient
6. WHEN I select the "solid" pattern THEN I SHALL see a plain background color
7. WHEN in dark mode THEN all patterns SHALL use appropriate dark theme colors
8. WHEN in light mode THEN all patterns SHALL use appropriate light theme colors

### Requirement 4: Performance and Responsiveness

**User Story:** As a user, I want wallpaper changes to be instant and smooth, so that the interface feels responsive and polished.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I select a wallpaper option THEN the change SHALL be applied within 100ms
2. WHEN wallpaper changes occur THEN there SHALL be smooth transitions between patterns
3. WHEN multiple wallpaper changes happen quickly THEN the system SHALL handle them without visual glitches
4. WHEN the page loads THEN the saved wallpaper SHALL be applied immediately without flash of unstyled content

### Requirement 5: Cross-browser Compatibility

**User Story:** As a user, I want the wallpaper feature to work consistently across different browsers, so that I have a reliable experience regardless of my browser choice.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using Chrome THEN all wallpaper patterns SHALL display correctly
2. WHEN using Firefox THEN all wallpaper patterns SHALL display correctly
